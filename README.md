👋 Hi there! I’m Aravind Vinod, a passionate Computer Science student and a tech enthusiast with a keen interest in Web Development, AI/ML, and DevOps.

🚀 I enjoy building practical and impactful applications, from AI-powered research assistants to file-sharing platforms. My recent projects include:

🌐 **File Sharing Platform:** A secure and minimalistic web app built with Django and Docker for seamless file management and previews.

💰 **Personal Finance Tracker:** A simple and efficient tool for tracking income and expenses, with user authentication and data persistence using JSON.

📝 **AI-Based Research Paper Summarizer and Translator:** An intelligent tool that generates concise summaries of research papers using BART and provides translation support.

💡 I’m constantly learning and exploring new technologies. My current focus is on mastering DevOps tools, cloud computing, and improving my skills in FastAPI, Flask, and microservices.
